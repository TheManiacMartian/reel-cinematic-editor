# Reel Cinematic Editor
A node-based tool for creating dialogue trees and cinematic scenes in Unity. Easily manage branching narratives and character interactions with a visual, drag-and-drop interface, little to no coding required. Ideal for building immersive storytelling in your games.

## Installing with Unity Package Manager
*(Requires Unity version 2022.1 or above)*

The Reel Cinematic Editor is designed to be [installed as a unity package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html) using this url:
```
https://github.com/TheManiacMartian/reel-cinematic-editor.git
```

### XNode Installation
This project is built on [xNode](https://github.com/Siccity/xNode) and therefore needs it as a dependency. Using the Unity Package Manager it should auto detect and download xNode automatically. But in the case that it doesn't or there is an error, please download xNode in the package manager using the same method as above, but using this link instead:

```
https://github.com/siccity/xNode.git
```
